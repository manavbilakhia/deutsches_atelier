				<p>In an increasingly globalized world, knowing german will give you acces to a new culture, and marketplace of three leading European nations: Switzerland, Austria, and Germany.  Together, the inhabitants of these three countries, combined with native speakers in other regions of the globe, make German the most spoken language in the European Union and the tenth most spoken language in the world.</p>

                <p>On a professional level, speaking and understanding another language opens many career opportunities.  German is one of the main languages used in business and international diplomacy.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, German became the lingua franca of central Europe, bridging the gap between former Cold War adversaries.  Many international conferences and trade shows also use German as their working language.</p>

                <p>Taking German classes will help to expand your understanding of another culture through a wide range of course offerings.  In business and social settings, being able to interact in a culturally appropriate manner is essential in order to seal a deal or make a transaction.  Understanding a bit of history and culture helps to make travel more enriching.</p>

                <p>Learning German will also enrich your personal life.  Maybe you have always wanted to explore your German heritage or are a German heritage language learner.  Perhaps you take an interest in German-American issues or have always wanted to study abroad.  Deutsches Atelier is the place to start.</p>
